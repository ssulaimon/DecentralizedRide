# Ride: Peer-to-Peer Ridesharing Platform

## Overview
Ride is a peer-to-peer ridesharing platform built on the Ethereum blockchain, leveraging its smart contract capabilities. This decentralized approach allows drivers to connect with passengers directly and earn cryptocurrency for each completed ride. The platform ensures the security of passengers by verifying all drivers through an admin DAO. Additionally, it guarantees fair pricing for all rides.

## Core Contracts

### Admin Contract
The Admin Contract is the cornerstone of driver management in the system. Key functions include:
- **Driver Registration**: New drivers submit their applications to become registered drivers.
- **Driver Pool Management**: Accepted drivers are added to the pool of available drivers.
- **Rule Enforcement**: Drivers who violate the system's rules are subject to penalties.
- **DAO Governance**: The contract is managed by DAO members, whose addresses are publicly visible for verification.

### Ride Contract
The Ride Contract handles all ride-related activities, including:
- **Ride Requests**: Passengers can request rides through the platform.
- **Ride Cancellations**: Users can cancel their ride requests if needed.
- **Payments**: Payments are processed securely using the platform's smart contracts.
- **Driver Ratings**: Passengers can rate their driving experience to maintain quality.

## Security and Fairness
Passengers are assured of safety and fairness:
- **Driver Verification**: All drivers are thoroughly verified by the admin DAO.
- **Fair Pricing**: The system ensures that all passengers pay a fair and equal amount for their rides.
